## Getting started
This application can be run directly or via Maven.
### How it was solved
* Create a maven project, create some tests and make sure the refactored version of the toll calculator passes All the tests
* Simplify and refactor what's tricky to interpret, e.g. the time range and the calculation logic by using more recent Date API and Google Guava library to handle ranges
* Split logic in different classes (could have been in the same class) and unit test each piece of logic
* Simplify methods that are exposed out

### Run the tests
```
mvn clean test
```
